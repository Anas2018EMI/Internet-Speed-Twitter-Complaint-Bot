# Internet-Speed-Twitter-Complaint-Bot
Whenerver your internet speed is below your ISP declared speed, this bot tweets about it!

You need to provide your Tweeter account credentials, your ISP name and the expected download and upload internet speeds. The bot will 
go to "https://www.speedtest.net/" to check your internet speed. If the measured speeds are inferior to the ones you specified, the bot logins to your Twitter account and tweets a complaint about it!

PS: You need to check your chrome version and download its correspondant web driver. Then you need to specify the chrome driver path in the script.
